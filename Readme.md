Image Search Engine
A powerful, multi-featured Image Search Engine built with Flask, PyTorch, CLIP, ResNet, and FAISS, capable of finding visually similar images based on deep features and color histograms.

Features

Search by Image: Upload an image and find visually similar results.

Multi-modal Feature Extraction:
CLIP ViT-B/32 (semantic embeddings)
ResNet50 (deep vision features)
Color Histograms (HSV)
Fast Similarity Search using FAISS (cosine similarity)

Caching: Embeddings are saved to speed up startup.
Password Protected UI

Dark Mode, Tailwind CSS UI, and responsive layout
Live Preview & Modal View for search results
Ready to deploy on localhost or cloud services

How It Works
Feature Extraction
Each image is transformed into a 5120-dimensional vector:
512 from CLIP (ViT-B/32)
4096 from ResNet50 (average + max pooled features)
512 from HSV color histogram (8x8x8)

Similarity Search
Vectors are L2-normalized and stored in a FAISS IndexFlatIP (Inner Product Index).
When an image is uploaded, its embedding is extracted and compared to others in the index.
Optionally detects exact matches using MD5 hash.

Caching
Feature vectors and metadata are cached in image_features.pkl to avoid re-processing.

Requirements
Install Python dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
requirements.txt

If using GPU, replace faiss-cpu with faiss-gpu.
Running the App

Place your reference images in the folder:
static/images/

Run the Flask app:
python app.py

Open your browser and go to:
http://localhost:5050

UI Password Protection
When the page loads, users are prompted to enter a password.
Default password: password

To change it, update this line in the HTML:
const CORRECT_PASSWORD = 'password'; // Change this

Usage Guide
Searching for Similar Images
Go to the home page.
Upload a query image (JPG, PNG, etc.)
Set the number of desired results (1–250).
Click Search Images.
Results will appear with thumbnails, scores, and match type.
Rebuilding the Index

If you add or remove images in static/images, click the Reindex endpoint via:
curl -X POST http://localhost:5050/reindex
Or trigger it via a browser with tools like Postman.

Example Use Cases
Product image search (e.g. “find shoes like this”)
Art or visual style similarity
Duplicate image detection
Color-based photo organization
Deployment Notes

Designed to run on localhost, but can be easily deployed using:
Docker
Heroku
AWS EC2
Railway.app

Make sure to adjust the UPLOAD_FOLDER and IMAGE_FOLDER paths if deploying to a different environment.
Set a strong password in production!

To-Do / Enhancements
 Add support for reverse color search
 Add pagination or infinite scroll
 Use CLIP text queries
 User image gallery
